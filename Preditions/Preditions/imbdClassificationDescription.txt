Dataset of 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so for instance the integer ”3” encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. This allows for quick filtering operations such as: ”only consider the top 10,000 most common words, but eliminate the top 20 most common words”.
The Convolutional Neural Network and LSTM was trained on this database and have the following average accuracy: 88.22%
